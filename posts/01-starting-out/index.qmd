After *many* years as a software engineer, I'm returning to physics. Not because my career requires it—though I hope it will benefit—but because I want to understand how the world works, and I love being able to compute things. It's one way to bring the theory alive.

In this blog I'll write about what I learn. The format is simple: study the physics, implement it computationally, write about both. The writing encourages clarity. The code allows me to test my understanding. More importantly, it allows me to *play* with the physics. Along the way, I hope it does something to convey the beauty we find in the universe.

## The plan

I've started working through some well-known physics texts. I've cracked open John R. Taylor's Classical Mechanics. After that I hope to work through Purcell and Morin for electromagnetism, Schroeder for thermal physics, and so on. As I write code I'll also dive into mathematics and numerical methods, but not by going through a text systematically. I'll dive into the topics that I need, when I need them.

I'll be designing computational projects as I work through the texts. Of course, Classical Mechanics leads to all kinds of interesting things like n-body simulations, orbital mechanics, and chaos. We'll be solving the wave equation numerically. Statistical mechanics leads to Monte Carlo methods. Quantum mechanics leads to solving the Schrödinger equation.

## Join me

I hope you join me in these explorations, and together we can explore some of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring things that humans have been able to understand about the universe.

More soon.
